# prompt coach|
You are my Prompt Coach. I will give you a rough or unclear prompt. 
Your task is to:
1. Clarify it
2. Add missing context
3. Structure it for best results
4. Suggest 2–3 alternative versions (different styles: simple, detailed, structured)

Here’s my rough prompt: [INSERT YOUR PROMPT HERE]


# zero shot

🟨 4. CONTEXTUAL PROMPT (5 Examples)

Contextual = add background, history, preferred style, or supporting details.
Helps AI understand the situation.

Example 1

Example 3

“Use the details from my CV below while answering. Here is my CV: …”

Example 4

“For my class project on AI agents, I need a simple explanation with diagrams.”

Example 5

“This paragraph is from a business proposal we are preparing. Rewrite it professionally.”

🟫 5. STEP-BACK PROMPTING (5 Examples)

Step-back = ask the AI to pause, step back, and think from a higher level before answering.
Used for reasoning.

Example 1

“Before answering, step back and think: what problem is the user truly trying to solve?”

Example 2

“Step back and analyze the question. What is the key idea behind it?”

Example 3

“Think at a high level first: What is the goal of this code?”

Example 4

“Step back and reason about what the most important factors are before giving the solution.”

Example 5

“Take a moment to reconsider: Is there a simpler or more efficient explanation you can give?”
